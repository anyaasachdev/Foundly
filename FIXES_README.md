# Foundly Fixes - Dashboard and Backend Issues

## üö® Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Member Count Issue
**Problem**: Dashboard was showing only 1 member when there were multiple members in the organization.

**Fix**: 
- Updated analytics and stats endpoints to count members from the organization's `members` array instead of counting users with the organization in their `organizations` array
- Fixed frontend components to properly handle member count data
- Added fallback logic for data consistency

### 2. Calendar Event Saving Issue
**Problem**: Users couldn't save events to the calendar.

**Fix**:
- Improved event creation endpoint with better date/time handling
- Added proper validation for required fields
- Fixed data structure handling for event creation and updates
- Added better error messages for debugging

### 3. Hours Logging Sync Issue
**Problem**: Hours weren't properly syncing and weren't viewable.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced hours logging endpoint with better validation
- Fixed data structure handling for hour logs
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Improved stats calculation to include logged hours

### 4. Backend API Structure Issue
**Problem**: Backend was using a single server.js file but Vercel deployment needed individual API files.

**Fix**:
- Created individual API files for each endpoint (events, hours, stats, analytics)
- Updated vercel.json to include all new API files
- Maintained consistent authentication and error handling across all endpoints

## üîß How to Deploy Fixes

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy-fixes.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy backend
cd backend
vercel --prod --yes

# Deploy frontend
cd ..
vercel --prod --yes
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging and Data Fixes

### Using the Debug Component
1. Navigate to the debug page in your app
2. Click "Run Debug" to see current data state
3. Click "Fix Organizations" to resolve data inconsistencies
4. Check the debug output to verify fixes

### Manual Data Fix via API
```bash
# Fix organization data inconsistencies
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/user/fix-organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Debug organization data
curl -X GET https://your-backend-url/api/debug/organization/ORG_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
