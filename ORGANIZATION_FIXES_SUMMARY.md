# Organization and Stats Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Organization Switcher Loading Issue ✅
**Problem**: Navbar showed "Loading organizations..." indefinitely due to inconsistent data structures and error handling.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Navbar.jsx**: Improved `loadOrganizations()` function with better error handling and data structure normalization
- **Data Structure Normalization**: Added consistent organization object structure with `_id` and `name` properties
- **Error Handling**: Better error states and retry functionality
- **localStorage Management**: Improved organization ID persistence and retrieval

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Organization loading and switching logic
- `src/services/api.js` - Consistent API response handling

### 2. Stats Synchronization ✅
**Problem**: Homepage and Stats page showed different numbers due to inconsistent API endpoints.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Unified Stats API**: Both HomeScreen and StatsScreen now use the same `ApiService.getStats()` method
- **Consistent Data Structure**: Standardized stats response format across all endpoints
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added fallback to main server endpoint if working API fails
- **Default Values**: Ensured consistent default values (minimum 1 member, 0 hours, etc.)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/api.js` - Unified getStats method
- `src/components/HomeScreen.jsx` - Uses consistent stats API
- `src/components/StatsScreen.jsx` - Uses same stats API as HomeScreen
- `backend/server.js` - Improved stats endpoint with organization stats
- `backend/api/working.js` - Consistent stats calculation

### 3. Hours Logging ✅
**Problem**: New hours overwrote the total instead of adding to it.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Backend Hours Endpoint**: Updated to properly increment organization stats
- **Working API**: Added organization stats update when hours are logged
- **Database Updates**: Hours now properly add to both user and organization totals
- **Consistent Calculation**: All endpoints now calculate total hours from database

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` - Hours logging endpoint with organization stats update
- `backend/api/working.js` - Hours logging with organization stats increment
- `src/services/api.js` - Improved hours logging validation

### 4. Member Count Accuracy ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent member counting across different endpoints.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Unique Member Counting**: Use Set to track unique user IDs only
- **Active Member Filter**: Only count members with `isActive !== false`
- **Minimum Member Count**: Ensure at least 1 member (current user) is always counted
- **Consistent Logic**: Same member counting logic across all endpoints

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` - Stats endpoint with proper member counting
- `backend/api/working.js` - Working API stats with consistent member counting
- `src/services/api.js` - Consistent stats response handling

### 5. Join Code Display ✅
**Problem**: Join code not always displayed on homepage.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Organization Structure Normalization**: Ensure join code is always available in organization object
- **Fallback Display**: Show "NO CODE" if join code is missing
- **Copy Functionality**: Improved join code copying with error handling
- **Admin Indicator**: Show admin badge for join code section

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/HomeScreen.jsx` - Organization structure normalization and join code display
- `src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Consistent organization structure

### 6. New Organizations Start Clean ✅
**Problem**: New organizations had leftover stats from previous data.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Clean Stats Initialization**: All new organizations start with `totalMembers: 1`, `totalHours: 0`, etc.
- **Organization Model**: Updated to include default stats structure
- **Creation Endpoints**: Both main server and working API create organizations with clean stats

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` - Organization creation with clean stats
- `backend/api/working.js` - Organization creation with clean stats
- `backend/models/Organization.js` - Default stats structure

### 7. Organization Creation Error ✅
**Problem**: "Body stream already read" error when creating organizations.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling to prevent body stream issues
- **Response Validation**: Check if response has already been sent before sending error
- **Input Validation**: Better validation of required fields
- **Join Code Generation**: Improved join code generation and validation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` - Organization creation endpoint with improved error handling
- `backend/api/working.js` - Organization creation with better validation

## Technical Improvements

### Data Structure Consistency
- Normalized organization objects across all components
- Consistent API response formats
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

### Performance Optimizations
