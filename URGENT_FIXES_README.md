# 🚨 URGENT FIXES - Foundly App

## Overview
This document outlines all the critical fixes that were implemented to resolve the major issues with the Foundly app.

## 🔥 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Login System - Multiple Users with Same Email

- `backend/models/User.js` - Removed unique email constraint

### 2. Dashboard Member Count
**Problem**: Dashboard was showing only 1 member despite multiple members being in the organization.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed analytics endpoint to count members from organization's `members` array
- ✅ Updated stats endpoint to use correct member counting logic
- ✅ Ensured frontend properly displays member count from API

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/api/analytics.js` - Fixed member counting
- `backend/api/stats.js` - Fixed member counting

- ✅ Fixed event update and delete functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/api/events.js` - Fixed event handling

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Backend Deployment
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel: `https://foundlybackend-alpha.vercel.app`
- ✅ All API endpoints configured
- ✅ Environment variables set
- ✅ CORS properly configured

### Frontend Deployment
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel: `https://foundly-olive.vercel.app`
- ✅ API service pointing to correct backend

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script has been created to verify all fixes:

```bash
node test-fixes.js
```

This script tests:
1. Multiple user registration with same email
2. Login functionality for each user
3. Organization creation and member management
4. Member count verification
5. Hours logging functionality
6. Calendar event creation and retrieval
7. Analytics and stats
8. Token refresh mechanism

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Login Test**: Try logging in with multiple users using the same email
2. **Member Count**: Create an organization and add members, verify count
3. **Hours Logging**: Log hours and verify they appear in the dashboard
4. **Calendar Events**: Create events and verify they persist
5. **Stats**: Check that all statistics are displaying correctly

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your Vercel deployment:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://foundly-olive.vercel.app
```

### API Endpoints
All endpoints are now properly configured:

- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/refresh`
- **Organizations**: `/api/organizations`, `/api/organizations/my`, `/api/organizations/join`
- **Events**: `/api/events`
- **Hours**: `/api/hours`
- **Stats**: `/api/stats`
- **Analytics**: `/api/analytics`
